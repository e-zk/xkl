xkl
===
X11 keylogger

About
-----
xkl comes in two parts:

    1. xkl: the keylogger itself
    2. xkd: log format decoder

xkl runs on the target's machine logging keys to a log file. Once the log file is extracted from the target machine it can be decoded to show the actual keypresses via `xkd`.

Usage
-----
To see this in action:

	$ ./xkl

This will show keypresses on stdout as a bunch of hex-encoded data. In real time we can pipe the output to the decoder to render it in a more human-readable format:

	$ ./xkl | ./xkd
	-----a
	-----Backspace
	---S-a

Now the actual keys that are typed can be seen, prefixed with the modifier in the following format:

	-----a
	S = super
	 A = alt
	  C = control
	   S = shift

In a more realistic usecase xkl will have it's output redirected to a file:

	$ ./xkl > logfile.txt

After, the log file can be decoded in the same way:

	$ cat logfile.txt | ./xkd
	$ # or
	$ ./xkd < logfile.txt

Relation to sxhkd
-----------------
A large portion of this code is from and/or based on the Simple X HotKey Daemon ([sxhkd](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd)).
